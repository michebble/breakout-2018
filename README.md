## Project Challenges
My personal goal for this project was to build a browser based game in Javascript. Initially, I intended to make a vertical scrolling shooting game using the recently released Phaser 3 library. However, I struggled with limited documentation, few examples, and the complexity of the type of game I intened to make. I dropped back to the better documented Phaser CE library and choose more basic game to build.
